Merchandise web pages typically include features such as product listings, shopping carts, payment gateways, and secure checkout systems. These websites may offer a wide range of products across various categories or focus on a specific niche. They provide users with the ability to browse products, compare prices, read reviews, and make informed purchasing decisions without the need to visit physical stores.

In addition to facilitating transactions, e-commerce websites often include other features such as customer accounts, order tracking, customer support, and personalized recommendations. They may also integrate with various payment methods, including credit cards, digital wallets, and online banking systems, to offer convenient and secure payment options for customers.
